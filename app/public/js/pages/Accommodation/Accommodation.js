              <h3>Children</h3>
              <p>
                Owing to limited space, Huntsham Court is only able to accommodate a small{' '}
                number of children. Priority will be given to those under 2 years old.{' '}
                Therefore, if you need to bring your children please let us know when you{' '}
                RSVP and we will try our best to accommodate them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note that according to Huntsham Court rules, children aged over 2{' '}
                require their own bed and therefore you may find it cheaper to stay in nearby{' '}
                accommodation or Airbnb.
